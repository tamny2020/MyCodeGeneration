    "Description": "Hello there,\n\nI'm using your project in an application where my users are able to generate bunch of code through an user-friendly GUI. Even it's work really fine, I just got a little \"bug\" (well, I know it's not a real bug) with specials characters like thoses ones : ' \" < > # etc. Thoses characters are interpreted like in HTML-code (&lt; &gt; etc.) like form, however it's not an awaited behavior.\n\nSo, here's my question : is there a way inside RazorEngine to disable this behavior, or should I handle with a method it in my template ?\n\n\nThanks for reading. Please excuse me for potential english mistakes.",
