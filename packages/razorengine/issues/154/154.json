      "Message": "This is due to GetReferencedAssemblies() not returning all required.  The compiler will omit unused references from the manifest of the compiled assembly, so as we were not explicitly using a type from the Microsoft.CSharp.dll assembly, that reference was removed at compilation, causing compilation issues while creating dynamic assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe solution seems to be to simply use an instance of a type from that referenced assembly and this allows unit tests to compile templates properly.  \r\n\r\nI've also changed the RazorCompiler to also add references to any assemblies referenced by RazorEngine.Core.dll.",
