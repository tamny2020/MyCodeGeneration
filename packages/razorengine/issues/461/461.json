    "Description": "When running Razor in a web context on a background thread WebCompilerServiceBase throws a NullReferenceException. This is due to using HttpContext.Current (which is ThreadStatic to the http request thread) to pass the compiler class name between WebCompilerServiceBase and RazorBuildProviderBase.\n \nI've attached a simple diff to add a static ConcurrentDictionary to RazorBuildProviderBase and use that when HttpContext.Current is null.\n \nI'm sure there's a better way though.",
