    "Description": "I seem to have problems running RazorEngine in a thread pool, even using the latest version from source I still get a bunch of errors parsing templates, my only hack for now is to put a lock around any code that uses RazorEngine. \nÂ \nIs there intended future support for a scenario like mine?",
