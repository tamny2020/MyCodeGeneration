    "Description": "Currently the Execute method writes the result to the Result property. While running in multiple threads this means the result is corrupted by multiple Execute runs in parallel. Need to investigate wrapping the execution and reading the result in a thread-safe method. This will likely be a breaking change to the ITemplate interface definition.",
