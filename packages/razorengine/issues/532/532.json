    "Description": "I've started getting this in my web application that makes use of RazorEngine.  It started after an update in which I copied in some new DLLs.  It's not always the same DLL it's failing on - sometimes it's one of my library DLLs and sometimes it's the web app's DLL.  There are not multiple copies of the DLLs.  The template has previously been parsed and compiled (prior to the app restart from updating the /bin folder).  Do the cached copies of the compiled templates get persisted somewhere that would cause problems when an app restart occurs?\nÂ \nError Parsing Template: RazorEngine.Templating.TemplateCompilationException: Unable to compile template. An assembly with the same simple name 'MyAssembly, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null has already been imported.

We get all the assemblies in the current AppDomain that aren't dynamic.\r\n2. A CompilerService can provide a separate set of assemblies that must be referenced (e.g. the CSharpDirectCompilerService references the Microsoft.CSharp lib for dynamic support).\r\n\r\nWe combine these and compare using Upper case to ensure that no duplicate assemblies are loaded.",
