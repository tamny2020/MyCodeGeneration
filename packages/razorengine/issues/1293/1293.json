    "Description": "I've found the one issue, but I don't know how to fix it correctly. Maybe you can help.\n\nImagine that you have 2 templates, and both use the same layout file. Layout doesn't have \"@model\" declaration while template 1 has \"@model List<..>\" and template 2 has \"@model MyClass\".\n\nWhen you perform RazorEngine.Razor.Parse(template1, model1, ...);, Razor caches _layout_ and remembers the type of the _current_ model.\n\nWhen you perform RazorEngine.Razor.Parse(template2, model2, ...);, Razor loads layout from the cache but throws an exception because it tries to cast model2 to the type of model1.\n\nOn my mind, Razor __shouldn't remember the type of the model for the layout caching__.",
