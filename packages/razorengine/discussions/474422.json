However when I try to use @Html in the Razor view I get the following exception. <br />\n  Message=Unable to compile template. The name 'Html' does not exist in the current context<br />\n<br />\nI found a stackoverflow discussion that seemed to be heading down the right road.  (From a comment in the HtmlTemplateBase that I got from WebApiContrib. ) but I have tried a few things based on it with no luck. (I added the SetTemplateService in WebApiConfig) Can anyone point me in the right direction? I suspect its something fairly obvious. I am not a full on C# dev, just getting started. <br />\n<br />\nThe link to the stack discussion is:<br />\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8561164/razorengine-issues-with-html/19434112\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a><br />\n<br />\nAny help will be very much appreciated even if its - go and post in another forum.<br />\ncheers<br />\n",
