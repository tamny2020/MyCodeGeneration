I'm new to Razor and find that I'm struggling with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;syntax errors in my templates. I'd love to be able to see the code that's generated to make it easier to\r\n figure out what's gone wrong.</p>\r\n<p>For example, here's a typical&nbsp;error message:</p>\r\n<pre>{c:\\Users\\scottb\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tedws2oh.0.cs(39,1) : error CS1501: No overload for method 'Write' takes 0 arguments}</pre>\r\n<p>There's a temporary source file mentioned there, but by the time I get the error message it's not on the drive any longer. The Line,Column number stuff isn't helpful since it's&nbsp;for the generated .cs file and not for the template file.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
