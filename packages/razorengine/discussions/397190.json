This is unacceptable as we need to know about any values that were missed by the substitution process so that we can decide weather to send the e-mail or not.</p>\r\n<p>I need a means of validating that the template and the object align and that all placeholders present in the template have been replaced by an actual value from the object.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Evan</p>\r\n",
