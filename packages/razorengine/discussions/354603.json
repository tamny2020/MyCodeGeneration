I need to embed this partial views into my base template, but the final result\r\n is rendered as plain text with tags. For example i need to have&nbsp;Header 2 but i see &lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt; on my page instead of parsed HTML.</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible to parse model data as HTML code?</p>\r\n",
