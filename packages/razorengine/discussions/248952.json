I'm not sure exactly how we could solve this problem in any way that doesn't require explicit information  from the user on whether or not the model contains any dynamic objects as we won't have that information. This is an interesting problem and I have a possible solution - I'm not sure how well it will work yet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So far it doesn't seem to work well. Though it's just a matter of me not fully understanding how ExpandoObject works. But I'm pretty sure I'm on the right track :)</p>",
